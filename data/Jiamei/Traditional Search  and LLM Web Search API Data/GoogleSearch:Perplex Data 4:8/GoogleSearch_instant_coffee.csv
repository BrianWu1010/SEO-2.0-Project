1,Twin Peaks Original Pour Over 100% Colombian Coffee,"As I already mentioned (a lot of times), the best instant coffee is also the best pour over coffee. Twin Peaks Columbian isn’t super strong but it has that nice, toasty, third-wave smell. As soon as I opened the packet I could tell this was nice coffee. I will admit, I’m not a coffee expert, but this is, without a doubt, a thousand times better than the instant coffee you’re used to. It was also better than all the other pour over packets we tried. Is strong and vibrant with a perfect amount of roastiness on the finish. This coffee is robust and downright silky, and it brews in just a few seconds as you pour hot water over the pouch. Add more water if you want it weak; add less if you want it strong. When it comes to the best tasting instant coffee, the world is your caffeinated oyster.",https://sporked.com/article/best-instant-coffee/,4,Google Search,best instant coffee,2025-04-08 23:49
2,Kuju Coffee Medium Roast Basecamp Blend,"First of all, let me say it’s very funny to me that this is “medium roast” coffee because it’s so, so strong. It’s, like, espresso strong. The coffee in the sachet is very finely ground, which I think contributes to the intensity of the flavor once hot water is added, but that’s also the nice thing about these pour over packets. You can add as much or as little water as you want. I would definitely add more hot water to make it more like an Americano than an espresso. The coffee itself promises flavors of oak, chocolate, and honey, and it definitely has plenty of complexity. The package doesn’t have info about the provenance of the beans, but if you’re not a total coffee freak, you probably don’t care. Important thing is, this stuff is good and strong! Kuju is one of the best instant coffee brands and you can find it on Amazon or at REI.",https://sporked.com/article/best-instant-coffee/,4,Google Search,best instant coffee,2025-04-08 23:49
3,Starbucks Dark Roast Premium Instant,"Of all the mix-and-stir instant coffees we tried, this is the best tasting instant coffee of them all (it was formerly #1 on our list, in fact). This one comes in a nice little tin that contains 40 cups worth of microground granules. It purports to be “bold & roasty,” and that’s about right. It’s certainly stronger than most of the others we tried, but it doesn’t taste too bitter or burnt (personally, I thought Starbucks’ instant French Roast was too bitter to make the list at all). Between the lovely presentation and the pretty decent coffee flavor, this instant coffee is way better than most.",https://sporked.com/article/best-instant-coffee/,4,Google Search,best instant coffee,2025-04-08 23:49
4,Starbucks Via Instant Colombia Medium Roast Coffee,"If bold coffee aroma is your thing, this is some of the best instant coffee to scratch that itch. This is perhaps the most convenient option on the list. You just dump a pre-portioned packet into a mug, add hot water, and you’re good to go. No measuring necessary. As far as flavor goes, this one definitely has a bit of bitterness but nothing you can’t get past. The roasty notes on the nose help it translate into a bold, mostly enjoyable cup of coffee.",https://sporked.com/article/best-instant-coffee/,4,Google Search,best instant coffee,2025-04-08 23:49
5,Café Bustelo Espresso Instant Coffee,"I have a soft spot for Café Bustelo. When I first got an extremely cheap espresso maker in college, I always brewed Café Bustelo because it’s affordable and reliable. This is definitely more aggressive tasting than the other coffees on the list, but that’s kind of what you want from an espresso, right? One taste tester called this “borderline too harsh,” but they meant it in a good way. If you want the best tasting instant coffee in a small dose, Café Bustelo is the best instant coffee brand.",https://sporked.com/article/best-instant-coffee/,4,Google Search,best instant coffee,2025-04-08 23:49
6,Nescafé Clasico Dark Roast,"It’s kind of hard to believe Nespresso and Nescafé share DNA. Both are Nestle products (hence the “Nes”). But Nespresso has become an upscale brand of machines and pods (here in L.A., one of our fancier malls has a whole-ass Nespresso store), while Nescafe’s most popular form is still instant crystals. I guess you could say Necafé walked so Nespresso could run. Anyway, this is a pretty classic and standard instant coffee. It isn’t the best instant coffee by any means, but it’ll get you through the morning in a pinch. A word of warning: When you’re in the coffee aisle, definitely go with this one over Nescafé Taster’s Choice, which we all thought was bitter, sour, and had an off-putting smell.",https://sporked.com/article/best-instant-coffee/,4,Google Search,best instant coffee,2025-04-08 23:49
7,Great Value Classic Decaf,"If you don’t drink decaffeinated coffee, there’s no reason to have a stash of decaf coffee grounds or decaf K Cups in the pantry—the coffee will just go bad. But if you want to be prepared for the odd guest who prefers not to consume liquid caffeine, having a jar of Great Value instant decaf on hand is smart. There are 120 cups in this jar, but I’d recommend adding more crystals to your cup than the instructions indicate to get a more bold flavor. Your decaf-loving visitors might not clamor for another cup, but they won’t avoid coming over either. It’s the best instant decaf coffee we tried in our taste tests—and it won’t go bad between decaffeinated visitors.",https://sporked.com/article/best-instant-coffee/,4,Google Search,best instant coffee,2025-04-08 23:49
